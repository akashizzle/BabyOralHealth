"Healthy pregnancy is important for healthy baby teeth:\n
So visit doctor frequently, eat balanced meals, have enough calcium,\n
avoid medicine without prescription, no cigarettes and no alcoholic drinks"

"First teeth may erupt at this stage.\n
Important to visit the dentist within six months of first teething.\n
Teething may be accompanied by pain in the gums, mild fever, rash around the mouth and ear infections.

After first teeth come into mouth:
- brush with soft bristled toothbush with small head

- brushing teeth is to remove plaque
- should ideally brush after each meal
- brushing should be long enough to clean plaque from all tooth surfaces
